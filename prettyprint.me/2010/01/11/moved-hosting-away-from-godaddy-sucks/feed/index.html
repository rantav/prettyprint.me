		<description>I paid $350 for Godaddy to design a website and they have been charging me a hundred dollars per month for hosting a site which has not yet been built nor published; even after I request that they cease charging my credit card.

I have not provided the content for them to build the site; but how can they start charging me for hosting a site that has not been built nor published.  I could understand if they tried to confiscate my $350 that I paid to build the site; but how could they justify stealing my hundred dollars PER MONTH for a fictional hosting of just a domain?

Has anyone else had this experience? Let&#039;s start a class action case...</description>

		<description>Godaddy is the worst service I&#039;ve ever seen. FREE SERVICES HAVE BETTER SUPPORT! I canceled my website service and it didn&#039;t even ask for a confirmation, they just went in and deleted everything. When I called in to ask them WTF they said it&#039;d cost 150$ to restore, they&#039;re f**king scam artists and if you&#039;re stupid enough to purchase their services you deserve to be taken for every dollar you have.

I&#039;ve been a loyal godaddy customer for three years and at the drop of a hat they basically told me to go f**k myself.

They&#039;ll hold your website hostage if they happen to get hacked or you accidentally do something you&#039;re not supposed to on their confusing piece of sh#t website. They won&#039;t even send you an email confirmation when it comes to deleting your entire website, BE WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</description>

		<description>I dealt with both companies.  From my experience, I went from bad to worse when I switched from Godaddy to Bluehost.  Hope it goes better for you.</description>
