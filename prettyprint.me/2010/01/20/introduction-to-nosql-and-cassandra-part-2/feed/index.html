		<description>Hi Mehar, one of the differences b/w SQL and Column oriented stores such as Cassandra is that you have to think very good when inserting your data, about how you&#039;re going to retrieve it. Unlike SQL, in cassandra you only have primary keys, no secondary indexes. What you&#039;re describing cannot simply be achieved in cassandra unless you plan for it ahead of time.
So if, for example, you create a CF Categories which is keyed by &quot;Category1&quot; etc and holds the list of all records belonging to Category1 then that would be possible. But the usual case is that this scheme also calls for a lot of data denormalizations and repetition, so there&#039;s a tradeoff.
You may also be interested in &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/digg/lazyboy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;lazyboy&lt;/a&gt;, which sort of implements secondary indexes scheme over cassandra.</description>

		<description>Hi Ran

I got some idea about cassandra after reading the above

We had some requirement like below

  I have a table which has the columns like           Category_name,Section_name,article,is_published_by  with  multiple records in the table. 

I want to retrieve a query based on condition like belongs some category_name &#039;X&#039; so then all values which belongs to X category will be retrieved along with other 3 columns

For E.g.,

select * from Table where category_name =&#039;Category1&#039;;

Here we are using category_name as key and retrieving all the records


Please let me know if it would be possible.

Can you please help me on this and kindly share your views.</description>
