		<description>Very nicely put Ran.

Still, in some companies where there&#039;s tons and tons of legacy code, some no longer maintained by anyone... it may be quite difficult to make that move.

It would have been nice to be able to iteratively migrate your code between one build to another, but it is usually pretty hard - you have to maintain 2 sets of &quot;dependency management data&quot;.</description>
