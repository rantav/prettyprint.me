Almost all new computers are shipped with 2 or more cores. Datacenter computers usually ship with more &#8211; 4, 8, 32&#8230; Again the hardware industry has left the software industry behind; if only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law">Moore&#8217;s law</a> would work the same way for software&#8230;</p>
<p>But there is hope!</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">Functional programming languages</a> used to be a niche for the small group of programing languages advocates or emacs fanatics <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />  I, for one, studied functional languages such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)">ML</a> at school but have never thought I&#8217;d ever use them in &#8220;real life&#8221; industry.</p>
<p>Things have started to change and in my opinion this is greatly due to the multi-core / huge datacenter / cloud computing shift in the software industry. The software industry has come to realize a few key points:</p>
<ul>
<li> One core can not handle the load, no matter how strong and fast is this core is. In the old days of <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/deepblue/">IBM deep blue</a> and the super-computer age there was hope that with the advance of hardware industry cores would get infinitely stronger and every other day there would be another contestant on the fastest/stronger/capable core of the day. However, in the last 10 or so years we have come to realize that hardware has its limitations and clock-rate is one of them. The cores, at least as far as we can tell today, can not grow infinitely and we need a different solution. The solution is multi-core CPUs. The challenge to the software industry is taking the right advantage over the multi-core business. It used to be easy when programming for a single core &#8211; you only had to come up with an O(good) algorithm and leave the real time issues to the hands of the hardware guys. But with multiple cores programmers (and not the hardware guys) need to take responsibility over utilizing theh cores;  and that&#8217;s hard. Increasing CPU clock-rate is just not going to do, we&#8217;ve decided to go for the multi-core solution.</li>
<li>Cloud computing. Cloud computing is here to stay. I won&#8217;t talk  about the user added value of cloud computing, you can find <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cloud+computing">plenty of this in other media</a>, but what I will talk about is the new challenges it creates for programmers. There are quite a few new challenges, most of them are about scale, such as scaling your database, scaling your users sessions etc, but one of the most significant challenges is scaling your algorithm by parallelizing  it. When dealing with multiple cores the way to scale your algorithm is to make it run in parallel &#8211; and this is hard; this is truly hard. One of the challenges in parallelizing the algorithm is synchronizing effectively over state. Java and other modern programming languages have created built-in constructs to assist in program synchronization, such as the <em>synchronized</em> block. This gives you the possibility to take advantage of multiple threads running on multiple cores of the same CPU, but it has two downsides &#8211; one, is that it doesn&#8217;t yet let you take advantage of multiple CPU datacenter and two, is that it&#8217;s very hard to program without creating botttlenecks. In many cases what you&#8217;d see is over-synchronization which results bottlenecks, poor performance in execution (not to mention the actual cost of the JVM going into the synchronized block itself) and at the end of the day, you might actually run your program faster if it was single threaded. The problem, just to make it clear, is that current imperative languages, such as Java and C++ all keep <strong>state</strong>. The state is in their variables. The thing is that when you want two or more threads to access the same variable, or the same state (and modify it) you need to synchronize them; Creating correct sycnronization is hard and many times results in bottlenecks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just to make that clear, when I say Multi-Core I mean two things actually: multiple cores on the same CPU, e.g. the same physical machine as well as multiple CPUs (machines) running in a datacenter.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where functional languages come to our rescue: They don&#8217;t keep state! Pure functional languages only present functions, which are pure computation and never keep state. Even in the not-so-pure functional languages, such as Scala, where the language does keep state, still programmers are encouraged not to use it and are given the correct constructs to use it less and use more pure functions which do not modify state (and simply return value) instead. Now, when you don&#8217;t keep state, you don&#8217;t need to synchronize state (there is always a bit of synchronization needed, but it lets you keep it to the minimum). Functional languages presnt pure-computation, a stateless computation; when computation is stateless it&#8217;s easy to run it in parallel on different parts of your data.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s impossible to run parallel computations in imperative languages, that&#8217;s obviously not true, what I am saying that it&#8217;s hard, it&#8217;s very hard. In functional languages its easier.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not surprise therefore that recently several functional (or semi-functional) languages have given rise, such as <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> and <a href="http://erlang.org/">Erlang</a>, as well as functional-like programming models for other imperative languages, such as Google&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">Map-Reduce</a>.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s put things in a historical context. Imperative programming languages such as C++ and Java is what&#8217;s currently driving the software industry. I think this is about to change. Both imperative and functional languages have co-existed for a long time, but it appears that the imperative family of languages have had the lead for the past 30 years or so and why is that? Performance, that&#8217;s why! On single cores there&#8217;s nothing like good-old C to run a fast program. You may agree or disagree on how &#8220;pretty&#8221; the program is, but you can not disagree that performance-wise the imperatives win, and performance is what counts, it allows for superb user experience, nice new and complex, computation intensive features etc. But history is moving fast and things have started to change. Today what&#8217;s becoming more and more mainstream is cloud computing and its massive amounts of data and computation. It used to be the case that programs were written for client side installation and clients used to be single-core with growing clock-rate. Now two things have happened simultaneously &#8211; one is that increasing CPU clock-rate has its limits, so the hardware industry is going towards the multiple core business, and two is that as networks become faster and with higher availability cloud computing has given the rise and it presents us with new challenges of massive amounts of data and massive amounts of users. With these two in place and with the realization that it&#8217;s very hard to utilize imperative languages for writing parallel programs the software industry has started its shift towards functional languages.</p>
<p>In the future increased parallelism, rather than clock rate, will be the driving force in computing and for this task functional languages are in the best position to take the lead.</p>

        <p>Good post Ran.<br />
one might say that the answer of the imperative languages to the &#8220;multi-core world&#8221; is multi-threaded programs.<br />
WRONG!!!!<br />
1. multi-threaded programming in language that &#8220;share stuff&#8221; basically requires threads synchronization which makes things run slowly.<br />
2. the more threads you have, the more context switches the CPU does &#8211; this is eventually not a simple task.</p>
<p>what functional programming is offering &#8211; run max 1 process per CPU core and share nothing between your processes.</p>
<p>simple to say but requires change in the way of &#8220;thinking about your software&#8221;.</p>

        <p>very interesting&#8230;just reading about clojure myself&#8230;.it is tough trying to shift thinking into a functional programming world&#8230;but interesting..will take a bit of practice</p>
<p>clearly its not practical for nothing ever to be shared between processes, however I can appreciate that mutable data has to be mitigated&#8230;.the idea of software transaction memory seems to fit the bill quite nicely <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

        <p>Functional languages usually do a better job when it comes to obviously parallel computations like a + b where a and b don&#8217;t depend on shared state but I haven&#8217;t seen much evidence of benefits when it comes to not so obvious parallel algorithms. Synchronization and state management are facts of life and if you don&#8217;t need synchronization and explicit state management then the imperative paradigm is just as good as the functional one, just spin up a thread for each independent unit of computation and you&#8217;re good to go. You can design the most beautiful parallel algorithm using your favorite functional language and it will all come to a grinding halt when the different parts of your algorithm start requesting non-parallel resources like files.</p>
<p>Now if you&#8217;d said we need more declarative languages because such languages let us focus on the big picture instead of the low level details and functional languages are a good example of the declarative paradigm then I&#8217;d agree with you but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s what you were going for and you just sound like another functional programming zealot championing the one true way for the future of computing.</p>

        <p>@david you make good points but I would add that functional languages not only make you think in higher levels but since they don&#8217;t share state, they also make you think of programming that doesn&#8217;t require state and sharing it (or require to less extent). I don&#8217;t agree that they are the most trivial tasks necessarily. If you look at how those problems are solved with Erlang, AKKA (Scala/Java Actors) and other languages then you&#8217;d agree that the problems are real.<br />
It&#8217;s not always &#8220;pure&#8221; functional, what that I can agree but they are much more functional than they are imperative.<br />
The symptom I see with many imperative language programmers such as Java is that they although they could use higher level abstractions that don&#8217;t require explicite sync and state management, they tend to use lower level ones just b/c they can and in most cases, that&#8217;s what they were taught. Functional languages suffer less from that.</p>

        <p>@ran I am not disagreeing with better and higher level concurrency constructs but I don&#8217;t understand what you mean &#8220;they don&#8217;t share state&#8221;. Erlang and AKKA (Scala/Java) still allow sharing state but they do it with message passing instead of shared variables. In most cases this works out better than using locks and shared variables but it&#8217;s got its own problems, e.g. messages get dropped or pile up, implicit ordering assumptions about message arrivals don&#8217;t hold, etc. If you&#8217;d like a general overview on such things I recommend <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/talk-by-haskell-expert-simon-peyton-jones/js-1434" rel="nofollow">http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/talk-by-haskell-expert-simon-peyton-jones/js-1434</a>. It&#8217;s a talk by Simon Peyton Jones about various approaches to concurrency and parallelism. He mostly focuses on STM but it&#8217;s still a pretty good talk.</p>

        <p>@david, I think we&#8217;re not disagreeing and indeed message passing has its own set of problems (and so does STM).<br />
My main theme was (and that was almost 2y ago) that if in the past imperative languages were attractive b/c of their low latency and close to the metal efficiency then today and in the future these kind of optimizations would seem less and less appealing to many types of apps that want to scale horizontally b/c the abstraction of shared memory is harder to scale than the abstraction of message passing (as an example). And functional languages encourage message passing more than they do shared memory.<br />
BTW, it&#8217;s great to have this discussion over comment, usually the breadth of comments on blogs is, well&#8230; of different kind <img src='../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
